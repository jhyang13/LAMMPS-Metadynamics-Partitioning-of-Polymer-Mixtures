Usage of "matrix70" analysis script: ./matrix70 cfg.txt

Explanation of and examples of parameters in input file "cfg.txt"

The output of the matrix70 program--"dimensions.data" and "partition.data"--can be further analyzed using the tools "generic_analyzer" and "autocorrelation," which are available on all local machines, e.g., "Achilles." For detailed usage instructions, see the following pages on the group wiki:

https://csml-wiki.northwestern.edu/index.php/Generic_Analyzer
https://csml-wiki.northwestern.edu/index.php/Autocorrelation

There are three example input/output files included: "equil.lammpstrj" is a sample LAMMPS dump file (current parameters in "cfg.txt" are for this dump file); "dimensions.data" and "partition.data" are sample output files. The version of matrix70 here produced these output files from the "equil.lammpstrj" and "cfg.txt" inputs. 

Note: many of the lines in the cfg.txt file aren't used by the matrix70 version of the analysis program. Don't remove these lines, because otherwise the program won't read the cfg file correctly and will return a fatal error.
